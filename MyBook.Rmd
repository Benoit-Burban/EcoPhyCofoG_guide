# Introduction {#intro}


Plant functional traits are the features (morphological, physiological, phenological) that represent ecological strategies and determine *describe?* how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels and influence ecosystem properties. Variation in plant functional traits, and trait syndromes, has proven useful for tackling many important ecological questions at a range of scales, giving rise to a demand for standardized ways to measure ecologically meaningful plant traits. The importance of these topics dictates the urgent need for more and better data, and increases the value of standardized protocols for quantifying trait variation of different species, in particular for traits with power to predict plant- and ecosystem-level processes, and for traits that can be measured relatively easily (Pérez-Harguindeguy et al., 2013)

This handbook presents the different protocols used in the ecophysio lab. We therefore suggest the methodological principles for a more open and transparent science. This handbook not only includes updated methods for the trait measurements, but also includes the excel worksheets for data collection and the associated R-scripts to upload/clean the raw data.

# Handbook architecture

This handbook is written for operational ends. As such, it is not a review or scientific paper thoroughly presenting each traits but rather a list of protocols associated with routinely measured traits in this lab.

Each chapter of this book correspond to one trait and associated measurement process.

# Leaf turgor loss point, $\pi_{tlp}$

We assessed the leaf turgor loss point, $\pi_{tlp}$ in MPa, from a previously established relationship with the osmotic potential at full hydration, $\pi_{osm}$ in MPa. $\pi_{osm}$ is linked to the equilibrium solute concentration value $C_0$ (in mmol.kg^{-1}) directly measured with a vapor pressure osmometer (Vapro 5600, Wescor, Logan, UT). This is referred as the *osmometer method* (Bartlett et al. 2012a; Maréchaux et al. 2016).

## Materials


* Vapor pressure osmometer (Vapro 5520, Wescor, Logan, UT)
* Vapro software (Vapro Lab Report)
* Fridge
* Liquid Nitrogen
* Ziplock bag  
* Paper towel 
* Distilled water
* Metal tea ball
* Tin foil
* Needle  
* Liquid nitrogen gloves + goggles
* Liquid nitrogen contenant
* 2 Tweezers
* Cork borer

## Methods

### Installing Vapro for measurements

* Turn on Vapro the day before for the thermocouple's stability
* Test Water Quality *cf Vapro_cheatsheet*
* Clean 
* Calibration *cf Vapro_cheatsheet*
* Control tests *cf Vapro_cheatsheet*
* Verify temperature
* Always have the black diamond at the center of the display

Used daily:
* clean beforehand
* select automatic mode (10 runs)

### Sampling on the field

* Collect at least 3 healthy mature leaves on branch
* Place them in sample ziplock bag with: 
  + wet paper towel
  + Exhale in bag to saturate in CO~2~
  + Annotate bag with sample information
* Zip bag and stock in cooler

### Lab measurements

#### Field day
* Recut branch under water
* Replace in ziplock bag with wet paper towel 
* Put 24h in fridge to hydrate overnight

#### N+1 Field day

Vapro: 
 
* check distilled water in vapro reservoir
* clean
* select automatic mode (10 runs)
* make sure vapro software is on 

Sample measurement:

* Sample from a leaf a 5 mm disc with a cork borer: *avoid 1^st^ and 2^nd^ order veins to avoid apoplastic dilution that would lead to less negative osmometer values*
* Wrap disc in tin foil
* Immerse in liquid nitrogen for at least 2 min using metal tea ball
* Puncture 10-15 times with needle 
* Place in vapro chamber

In total, disc are exposed to air for less than 40 seconds for all the steps. 

* Record value C~0~ when the difference between consecutive 2-min measurements fell below strictly 5 mmol.kg^-1^ after at least three runs.

* If error! or Nr_Run > 10 : 
+ try a 2^nd^ cycle with same leaf
+ try a 3^rd^ cycle with another leaf 
+ otherwise record *NA*

* Beware of the stuck leaf inside the vapro! If so *cf Vapro_cheatsheet*


#### End measurements

Clean Vapro

For more information on the vapro machine, please refer to the *vapro cheatsheet* in the machine category.

title: "Memoir Template"
output: html_document
---

This template is based on _Bookdown_ and the _Memoir_ LaTeX class to allow writing a book, a report, a PhD thesis, etc. in _R Markdown_.

The main file is _index.Rmd_ which contains the description of the book in its header. All other _.Rmd_ files in the folder contain a chapter. 
The _references.bib_ file contains the bibliography.

This file will have to be deleted, as well as _81-getting_started.Rmd_ and _82-syntax.Rmd_: they have to be replaced by the content of the book.

To get started, create a new R project from this folder.
Then open _index.Rmd_ and click on the _Build Book_ button in the _Build_ window of Rstudio.
