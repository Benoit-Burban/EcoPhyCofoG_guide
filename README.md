# [User's guide for Ecofog's Ecophysiology Lab](https://GitHubID.github.io/Repository//index.html)

This is the user's guide containing all protocols and informations related with plants measurements performed at EcoFoG.
The goal is to have one common protocol resource for all researcher and students working on similar questions with similar tools.
As authors are involved in bacterial and fungal metabarcoding project we might add a metabarcoding chapter :)!

You are invited to contribute using Pull requests in github.

To ensure good functioning we invite you to only modify chapters files (`.rmd`) starting with numbers (*e.g*, 02-architecture or 06-fluxes_and_gaz_exchanges).
You can also add resources (protocol pdf or supporting images in the `document` folder.
